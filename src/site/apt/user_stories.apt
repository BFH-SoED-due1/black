roles users have when using the Smart Reservation System (SRS).

  [Administrator] Person who enters and manages the rooms that can be booked.

  [System Administrator] Person who manages the security and accounts if need be.

  [Accounting Service] System that manages the billing process.


* 2. User Stories

  Describe the user stories you have identified so far. Provide a table,
and number the stories. Provide a short text for each user story by using
the format as presented in the script. In the last column, provide one
or more criteria which can be used to validate whether the user story is
correctly implemented.
